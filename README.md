# RandomForest
The goal of this project was to create a Random Forest class, from scratch, with similar accuracy to the class in sklearn. I create both regressor and classifier objects which take decision tree classifier and regressor objects that I also created from scratch. My implementation also supports OOB validation error estimation. At the request of my professor, this code is not publicly available, but I am allowed to share with potential employers.
